Public forms
------------

Import data from public forms 101 (additional files) and 102 
    - Desired solution is that all is needed to import a new form is to add its description to global_ini.py FORM_DATA, but it may not be that easy. Still, better try adding one fmore form, think of what can be done to make this more standard/patter-like and make next form import implementation easier.  
	
	- Import was earlier implemented in PHP in https://github.com/zimBop/dbfToMysql	- comments are in Russian. Fiel read functions are in 
	https://github.com/zimBop/dbfToMysql/blob/master/functions.php. This may be used for reference (e.g. fields), but current implementation. 
	
	- Tentative plan:
	  inspect and agree what fields are imported for each final table
	  design or retieve from previous implementation CREATE TABLE code, add necessary tables to both raw and final database
	       see file create_more_tables.sql for final table descriptions.
	  write converter function from DBF to CSV
	  import CSV to raw database
	  inspect data in raw database (informal test)
	  struggle with special cases (data type different from declared, dates in fields do not coincide with file date, etc)
	  truncate data same way when moving from raw to final table
	  migrate final table from raw to final database
	  see how much of this can be offloaded to FORM_DATA definition and where specific functions are needed. 
	  
	- Need add 964 to bank list.
