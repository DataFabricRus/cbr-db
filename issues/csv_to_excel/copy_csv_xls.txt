Task A.
Assemble CSV to a new XLS/XLSX file. 


Task B. 
Write data from CSV files to sheets in an existing XLS (not XLSX) file.
1. Delete data on CSV sheets (but not the sheets, as there are links to them inside the file)
2. Copy data from CSV files to corresponding sheets starting A1 in each sheet
3. Save under name like reference_view_balance_2015_03_02_14-30.xls with date and time. 

Requirement:
- keep filename, CSV file names and sheet names in constants

Testing evironment:
Python 3.4.3 :: Anaconda 2.2.0 (32-bit)

CSV file               Sheet
--------------------   ---------
tmp_output_itogo.txt   csv_itogo
tmp_output_ir.txt      csv_ir
tmp_output_iv.txt      csv_iv


Excel file: reference_view_balance_2015_03_02_14-30.xls


Further note:
may use something different form 'xlwings', but better if the package is already in Anaconda 
also better use fewer dendencies. 
Choice of packages is not trivial. 
I have pandas and xlwings working on my work machine.

There script_version.py provided, but it is not a very good realisation.

Re-create 9 graphs on Excel worksheet each pointing to a different dataset.
