TODO
====
update tests for cli_dates.py - see commented code in bootom of file cli_dates.py (I changed the command line interface, now several date formats can be supplied as input)

inspect date_engine.py for orphan functions, document necessary changes. what modules use functions from there?

there are warnings in mysqlimport of standard csv files, need to find out reason for these warnings (replicate same import with sql's "load data" then "show warnings")

DONE
====
.gitignore - delete it
supply Excel file output, specification and previous realisation for –csv –xls keys. 

2015-06-15 05:20 PM
build xls file 
make output common directory - write .sql there
delete temp sql files in ouptput directory 
new dates interface

read private data to final/raw database 
    Private data is text files with same logic structure as DBF. A separate altorightm is
	used to convert these text files to csv's readable by mysqlimport. These CSVs can be 
	imported directly to raw database. text files are in data.private.rar, conversion algorithm is in veb_txt.py.
	
	Steps:
    define directories where private data text files are stored, and csv files are created
    convert text files to csv files (using veb_txt.py). 
	import csv files to raw database (import_veb.bat). import_veb.bat imports all available csv files, because it is a quick job to do. I think myslqimport call is slightly different from the one used for other csv files - please document it too.
	integrate calls into bankform.py command line interface (no dates, this will for now work on all files):
	     bankform.py make csv <FORM> --private-data [--all-dates]
         bankform.py import csv <FORM> --private-data [--all-dates]

NOT TODO
========
f101 integrity check
read from DBF to final database directly
explicit regn and date limit when truncating raw database (hardcoded in database)
    bankform.py make dataset <FORM> --regn 956,1000 --regn-file regn.txt --year 2015
‘Import tables’ is not very clean, it is actually about importing names/plan from files
think of top-30 test
form 102
restore documentation, make readme.md
5 bank balance output 

COMMENT
=======
something to start mysql server/daemon (now manually in Windows)
date_engine.py - some spagetti around format conversion, seems even not all functions are used
pandas dataframe  - more explicit data aggregation algorithm 
SQLA abstraction of SQL queries
sql outputs to screen - date formats.
